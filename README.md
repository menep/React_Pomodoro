A timer that can enhance your productivity by going through a sequence of fixed productive intervals, each followed by fixed intervals for a break.

## User stories:

- I can select the duration of the intervals for both work and breaks
- I can select how many cycles I want to go through (one cycle is a work interval followed by a break interval)
- I can start, stop and reset the countdown
- I can see how many minutes and seconds are left
- When the countdown reaches 00:00, the following interval starts

## Motivation
I've created this app to practice React.
It will be developed as a standalone, but the idea is to later implement it into my collection of React apps:

## Practiced features:



## How to install
npm install

## How to run
npm start
